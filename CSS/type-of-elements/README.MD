# Type of Elements

## inline elements

What will be the width of the span in the code snippet?

```CSS
span {
  width: 200px;
  background: red;
}
div {
  width: 500px;
}
```
```HTML
<div>
<span>Lorem Ipsum</span>
</div>
```
`<span>` is an inline HTML element.

`inline` elements as a name suggests are those which only occupy the space bounded by the tags defining the element, instead of breaking the flow of the content.

The width and height are not respected. The width would be always equal to the content width for all `inline` elements.
